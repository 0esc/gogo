Open-Source Phishing Toolkit

Gophish is an open-source phishing toolkit designed for businesses and penetration testers. It provides the ability to quickly and easily setup and execute phishing engagements.

###Current Status
**Update 10/22/2015**

Gophish is almost ready for its alpha release! Just fixing some last minute bugs to make it as clean of a release as possible, then I'll tidy up docs and ship it out.

Until that happens, you can keep up-to-date with development news and articles on [my blog](http://jordan-wright.github.io/blog/categories/gophish/).

###Install

Installation of gophish is dead-simple - once the binaries are released (coming soon!), just download and extract the zip, and run the binary. Gophish will have binary releases for all platforms.

**If you are building from source, please note that Gophish requires Go v1.5 or above!**

###Setup
After running the gophish binary, open an Internet browser to http://localhost:3333 and login with the default username (admin) and password (gophish).

###Documentation

Documentation is a work in progress. Existing documentation can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/jordan-wright/gophish/wiki). Find something missing? Let us know by filing an issue!
